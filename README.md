-> The original project didn't work on all of the machines so i merged the classes and put them in the main.cpp
   i know this is not the best practice but it's for testing only 

-> to view the project with class headers seperated go to /classes folder or go to classes branch -> https://github.com/AbdAlRahmanGad/SchoolManagemetSystem/tree/classes
